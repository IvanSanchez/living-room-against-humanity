The questions of the Cards Against Humanity™ game, on your living room.

# Where?

# What?

Maybe you know [Cards Against Humanity™](http://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com). It's a party card game where you end up acting like a horrible person.

Maybe you have a computer screen in the room where you usually play this game. Maybe you're bored of handling the black cards around.

If that's the case, load up Living Room Against Humanity in a web browser, go fullscreen (hint: press F11), and press any key whenever you need a new black card.



# Caveats

The deck of cards is shuffled at the beginning of the game, so cards are not repeated during a game. If you hit the bottom of the deck, just reload the webpage (F5) to play more.

Right now, only the cards from the base game are used. If I'm bored enough, I'll code up a way to select questions from the expansion decks.
